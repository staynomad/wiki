# Onboarding #
Your guide to onboarding with Nomad!  

---

## Background ##

#### Product Overview ####
Nomad is a **prop-tech homesharing startup** with a goal to provide a one-stop affordable rental platform for digital nomads and travelers across the world. We appeal to the desires for high quality, budget housing through features such as **rent splitting** and price guarantees.

Nomad acts as a third-party SaaS, bridging the gap between property owners looking for tenants and guests looking for places to stay. Currently, Nomad's platform is located at [visitnomad.com](https://visitnomad.com). The admin dashboard, which is an internal tool for Nomad team members, is located at [admin.visitnomad.com](https://admin.visitnomad.com) and the staging environment is located at [staging.visitnomad.com](https://staging.visitnomad.com).

#### History ####
Born out of the UCLA Anderson Venture Accelerator, Nomad was founded by Aiden Szeto and Michael Vilardo. Prior to rebranding as Nomad in February 2021, the company was known as VHomes and had earned over $50,000 in non-dilulted funding.

To this date, Nomad (formerly VHomes) has garnered 15+ listings in both the United States and Mexico, and has already received it's first reservation. In the summer of 2021, Nomad took down their live site with the goal to relaunch the platform on September 1st, 2021.
